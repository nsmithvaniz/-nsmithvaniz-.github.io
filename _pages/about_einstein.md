Hello! I'm Nicole, a public health student at Tulane University with a passion for writing and a growing interest in artificial intelligence. I've been a writer for as long as I can remember. In first grade, I asked my teacher for an extension on a story project and ended up turning in a 40-page story complete with a developed plot and characters. I believe writing has a unique power to inform and hopefully inspire, and while I am not sure what the future may hold, I aim to blend this passion with my public health career. Recently, I took a course on artificial intelligence, which helped me discover my interest in machine learning. Recognizing I will have much to learn if I would like to take part in work involving ML, I have taken proactive steps to familiarize myself with computer science principles and programming languages. My pursuit of self-directed learning in computer science reflects my dedication to expanding my skill set and adapting so that I may contribute to the field. When I'm not studying or working, you'll find me indulging in my favorite hobbies. I run two food photography blogsâ€”one dedicated to cooking and another to exploring restaurants. I also enjoy rock climbing and ultimate frisbee. But most noteworthy is my affinity for Taco Bell. I'm a dedicated fan and a Fire Rewards member on their app. For those who aren't avid fans, this status requires extensive ordering of Taco Bell. My car is covered in Taco Bell stickers, I rock Taco Bell Crocs, and even stayed up until 3 AM while studying abroad in Japan to watch their yearly livestream for new menu item releases. Taco Bell hasn't acknowledged my numerous messages and calls yet, but I remain hopeful and persistent.
